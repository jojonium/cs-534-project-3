# CS 534 Artificial Intelligence Project 3
This grid world program is written in python 3.7
To run this program make sure Python is installed
and numpy is installed as well. 

If numpy is not installed, you can install it from
the command line with the command
> pip install numpy

To run the program go to the command line and type
> python gridworld.py [test.csv] [movecost] [probability of successful move]

Where test.csv is the grid world you want it to solve, the move cost is the
cost per move (should be a negative number), and probability of successful move
is the probability to make a correct move.
